    <h1>Nashville Hot Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/images/nashville-hot-chicken.jpg">
    <p>Nashville Hot Chicken is one of my favorite dishes to make. It's
        incredibly simple and filling, with kids and adults alike
        able to enjoy the flavor (if they like spice!!)
    </p>
    <p>Are you ready to dig in?</p>

        <li>Heat some peanut oil to 375 degrees</li>

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>Carefully add the chicken into the oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot
        </li>
        <li>While the chicken is frying, get a separate bowl and add in the brown sugar and cayenne pepper.
            It should be equal parts, along with the other seasonings that you wish to add.
        </li>
        <li>Take some oil out of pot that is cooking and add it to the brown sugar/cayenne pepper
            mixture. Keep stirring until you get a smooth consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Once chicken is done cooking, transfer to a metal bowl and toss it with the Nashville
            hot sauce. Enjoy!
