    <p>Are you ready to dig in?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of Pasta</li>
        <li>1 can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>8oz of Parmesan</li>
        <li>2-3 tbl spoons of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1oz of vodka</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>5-6 cloves of garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a pot of heavily-salted water and let your pasta cook for about 8 minutes</li>
        <li>Finely chop the shallots and garlic, and add them to
            a pan with a tablespoon of butter on medium heat
        </li>
        <li>Once the shallots become translucent and the garlic just begins
            to brown, add the can of tomato paste and let it cook for about 4
            minutes
        </li>
        <li>Deglaze the pan with the vodka, and cook out the alcohol
            for about 2 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Begin thinning the tomato paste out with 2-3 heaping spoons
            of the pasta water, as well as the heavy cream. Add more pasta
            water to achieve the ideal consistency
        </li>
        <li>Add the parmesan in small scoops</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta water and add in the pasta. Stir the pasta
            until it is covered in the vodka sauce
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle some extra parmesan and serve!</li>
    </ol>
